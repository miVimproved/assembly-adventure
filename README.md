# learning-linux-asm

I'm trying to learn Linux x86_64 asm, and here is the history of that!

I do not know what I'm doing. I'm just here to frick around and find out. If you expect to see quality code here, don't! I'm going to end up doing whatever I feel like doing with this, and maybe make a game if I feel like it.
